`nwidart/laravel-modules` is a Laravel package which created to manage your large Laravel app using modules. Module is like a Laravel package, it has some views, controllers or models. This package is supported and tested in Laravel 10.

This package is a re-published, re-organised and maintained version of [pingpong/modules](https://github.com/pingpong-labs/modules), which isn't maintained anymore.

With one big added bonus that the original package didn't have: **tests**.

## Install

To install via Composer, run:

``` bash
composer require nwidart/laravel-modules
```

The package will automatically register a service provider and alias.

Optionally, publish the package's configuration file by running:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nwidart\Modules\LaravelModulesServiceProvider"
```

### Autoloading

By default the module classes are not loaded automatically. You can autoload your modules by adding merge-plugin to the extra section:

```json
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "dont-discover": []
    },
    "merge-plugin": {
        "include": [
            "modules/*/composer.json"
        ]
    }
},
```

**Tip: don't forget to run `composer dump-autoload` afterwards.**
